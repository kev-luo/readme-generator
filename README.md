## Description
This repository allows users to generate readMe files based on a pre-defined template. By utilizing Inquirer, a command-line interface for Node.js, the user is presented with a series of questions to populate the readMe with repo-specific information. The main takeaway from this assignment was learning the importance of code modularization. Making the markdown template a separate file allows others to more easily integrate my template into their own projects. This is essentially what makes NPM so useful. Piggy-backing off of this, what makes sharing code a lot less cumbersome is the package.json file. By listing the dependencies in this file, all a user has to do it run npm install in their command line to install all the packages required to run an application.
